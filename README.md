# CS320-Software-Test-Automation-QA
Includes files from a "contact" feature written for Project 1 (Grand Strand Systems Mobile Application) and a Summary/reflection on JUNIt Testing and my approach when coding the features of the project 


#How can I ensure that my code, program or software is functional and secure?

Testing is a crucial part of writing code that is functional and secure. Following a religious testing schedule or implementing a DevSpecOps appoach will help ensure that the code written is continuously tested and properly integrated. Usage of CI/CD tools is also an important aspect of ensuring that the final deliverable has no vulnerabilities. 


#How do I interpret user needs and. incorporate them into a program?

Understanding the software requirements of a certain project is essential in writing the correct solution for users or a client. It is crucial to understand the users and what their goals are within the system. Once thee latter is properly understood, requirements should be established and collaborated on with the cilent. Once information is gathered and you have designed a solution for the potential user, writing small exerpts of code combined with testing functionality and technical accuracy is important. A user-centered approach is recommended to ensure that product owners or stakeholders are receiving what they are asking for. 

#How do I approach desigining software? 

My appoach to designing software has significantly changed after taking this course. The mindset of test-driven develpoment ensures functional code that is efficient. Another aspect to keep in mind is to use the corerct data structures as deliverable software must have ideal memory and space requirements when being used by multiple users or a whole company overall. Understanding requirements and writing code that solves the user's purpose is equally important.
